# Comparing Temperatures

Prints a simple exercise for practising comparisons of positive and negative temperatures (-50°C - +50°C) using real city names, however temperatures are not correlated to true temperatures in the given cities.

e.g.:


```
In Rome it is -30°C.
In Madrid it is 49°C.
-30°C __ 49°C
Rome is hotter/colder.
Madrid is hotter/colder.
The temperature difference is ___ °C.
```
