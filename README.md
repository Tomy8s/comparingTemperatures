# Comparing Temperatures

Prints a simple exercise for practising comparisons of positive and negative temperatures (-50°C - +50°C) using real city names, however temperatures are not correlated to true temperatures in the given cities.

e.g.:


```
In San Juan it is -13°C.
In Bogotá it is 20°C.
-13 __ 20
San Juan is hotter/colder.
Bogotá is hotter/colder.
